<p>The <a href="https://github.com/OwlCarousel2/OwlCarousel2/issues">issue tracker</a> is the preferred channel for bug reports, feature requests, and submitting pull requests.</p>
<p><strong>Please do not use the issue tracker for personal support requests. Stack Overflow (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/owl-carousel"><code>owl-carousel</code></a>) is a better place to get help.</strong></p>
<h3 id="bug-reports">Bug reports</h3>
<p>A bug is a <strong>demonstrable, reproducible problem</strong> that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!</p>
<p>Guidelines for bug reports:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use the GitHub issue search — check if the issue has already been reported.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Check if the issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the latest <code>develop</code> branch in the repository.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Isolate the problem - you NEED to provide a live example — ideally also create a reduced test case. This <a href="https://codepen.io/anon/pen/prvbMp">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/h8x8bvn9/2/">JSFiddle</a> and <a href="https://jsbin.com/bojonaceve/2/edit?html,js,output">JS Bin</a> are helpful templates you can fork or clone.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Short and descriptive example bug report title</p>
<p>A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.</p>
<ol>
<li>This is the first step</li>
<li>This is the second step</li>
<li>Further steps, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>&lt;url&gt;</code> - a link to the reduced test case</p>
<p>Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their merits).</p>

<h3 id="feature-requests">Feature requests</h3>
<p>Feature requests are welcome, but please take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It&#39;s up to you to make a strong case to convince the project&#39;s developers of the merits of this feature.</p>
<p>To get approval for your feature request, please create an issue on the issue tracker with as much detail and context as possible. We&#39;ll take a look at it and then [hopefully] apply the &quot;<a href="https://github.com/OwlCarousel2/OwlCarousel2/labels/approved%20for%20development">approved for development</a>&quot; tag so someone can get to work on it!</p>
<h3 id="pull-requests">Pull requests</h3>
<p>Good pull requests are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.</p>
<p>Adhering to the following process is the best way to get your work included in the project:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/">Fork</a> the project, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">git clone https://github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/OwlCarousel2.git
cd OwlCarousel2
git remote add upstream https://github.com/OwlCarousel2/OwlCarousel2.git
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">git checkout develop
git pull [--rebase] upstream develop
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Create a new topic branch (off the main project <code>develop</code> branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">git checkout -b &lt;topic-branch-name&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Build the distribution before committing to ensure your changes follow the coding standards and all build files are up to date.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">grunt dist
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these <a href="http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">guidelines</a>. Use Git&#39;s <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase">interactive rebase</a> feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">git pull [--rebase] upstream develop
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Push your topic branch up to your fork:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">git push origin &lt;topic-branch-name&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">Open a Pull Request</a> with a clear title and description against the <code>develop</code> branch.</p>
</li>
</ol>
