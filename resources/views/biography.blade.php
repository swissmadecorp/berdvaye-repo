                <h4>Berd Vaye</h4>
                <i>Modern Art with Vintage Parts</i>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Founded in 2014, Berd Vaye is the unique creation of Edward K. and 
                    Albert A., two dynamic individuals with decades of experience 
                    in the fine watch and jewelry industry. Inspired to create 
                    art that showcases the complexity of fascinating watch movements 
                    from different eras and vast parts of the world, Edward and Albert 
                    created their own art to beautifully exhibit the watch movement. 
                    As avid art collectors and horological connoisseurs themselves, 
                    Edward and Albert experimented with various shapes, sizes, and materials
                    that they could create in order to showcase their passion and innovation 
                    for watch parts and exquisite artistry, ultimately creating the Berd Vaye 
                    masterpiece collections.

                <h4>THE CREATORS</h4>
                <b>Edward K.</b>
                <p>
                    Growing up in a family of artists, Edward’s obsession for the beauty of 
                    watchmaking began at 10 years old when opening and disassembling his father’s pocket watch. 
                    After moving to the United States in High School he began working around New York city’s 
                    Diamond District and began forming relationships with some of the most prominent watch 
                    dealers in the industry.

                <p> 
                    <b>Albert A.</b><br>
                    Albert grew up admiring his father’s watch collection and received his first watch (a Casio) 
                    as a special gift at the age of 13. At the age of 17, Albert started working for his cousin’s 
                    jewelry shop changing batteries on quartz watches. During this time, Edward and Albert sat next 
                    to each other in high school and formed a strong bond over their passion for watches. 
                    Edward introduced Albert to one of the only female pioneers in the industry who was looking 
                    for an apprentice. After learning about mechanical watches, Albert worked for another 
                    company in the Diamond District where he formed extensive knowledge about the Rolex market and 
                    grew his network within the secondary market.
